Binit NWHacks 2025 

Inspiration 

We were inspired to build Binit when we learned about the waste that gets thrown in the wrong bins—like recyclables in the trash or compostables in the recycling bin. These improper disposals lead to millions of tons of waste ending up in landfills, emitting harmful CO2, and contributing to deforestation. If managed properly, we could save trees and reduce carbon emissions, making a significant positive environmental impact. 

What it does 

With a simple photo, Binit uses the Gemini API to instantly categorize waste, showing users exactly which bin to dispose of it in. Properly disposing of waste earns points, boosting your rank on the leaderboard. Binit tracks your waste management and environmental impact with a clean, minimalist interface, making it easy to monitor your progress. With Binit, you can change the world, one bin at a time! 

How we built it 

We used React for the frontend and Tailwind for styling. 

Waste classification is powered by the Gemini API. 

Axios and RESTful APIs were used to establish a connection between the frontend and backend. 

The backend is built with Django, and we’re using SQLite for the database. 

Challenges we ran into 

Integrating Django with React presented a unique challenge, as one team member was focused on frontend development with no backend experience, while the other was skilled in backend but lacked frontend expertise. This made communication and collaboration between the two sides challenging, but we were able to overcome it with consistent teamwork and problem-solving. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of 

Developed our first full-stack website and successfully integrated the frontend and backend. 

Designed a user-friendly, fully responsive UI. 

Implemented an account system using Django. 

Wrapped up the Gemini API to classify waste and provide real-time data. 

What we learned 

React for frontend development. 

Working with RESTful APIs to connect frontend and backend. 

Django for backend development. 

Integrating external APIs like Gemini API for waste classification.
