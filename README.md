## **Inspiration**
We were inspired to build **Binit** when we learned about the waste that gets thrown in the wrong bins—like recyclables in the trash or compostables in the recycling bin. These improper disposals lead to millions of tons of waste ending up in landfills, emitting harmful **CO2**, and contributing to **deforestation**. If managed properly, we could **save trees** and reduce carbon emissions, making a significant positive environmental impact.

## **What it does**
With a simple photo, **Binit** uses the **Gemini API** to instantly categorize waste, showing users exactly which bin to dispose of it in. Properly disposing of waste earns **points**, boosting your rank on the **leaderboard**. **Binit** tracks your waste management and environmental impact with a clean, minimalist interface, making it easy to monitor your progress. With **Binit**, you can change the world, one bin at a time!

## **How we built it**
- We used **React** for the frontend and **Tailwind** for styling.
- Waste classification is powered by the **Gemini API**.
- The backend is built with **Firebase**, utilizing **Firestore** for the database and **Firebase Authentication** for user management.

## **Challenges we ran into**
Integrating **Firebase** with **React** presented a unique challenge, as one team member was focused on frontend development with no backend experience, while the other was skilled in backend but lacked frontend expertise. This made communication and collaboration between the two sides challenging, but we were able to overcome it with through communication and collaboration.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- Developed our **first full-stack web app** and successfully integrated the frontend and backend.
- Designed a **user-friendly**, fully responsive UI.
- Implemented an **account system** using **Firebase Authentication**.
- Wrapped up the **Gemini API** to classify waste and provide real-time data.

## **What we learned**
- **React** for frontend development.
- Working with **RESTful APIs** to connect frontend and backend.
- **Firebase** for backend development and database management.
- Integrating external APIs like **Gemini API** for waste classification.

## **What's next for Binit**
- Incorporate **real environmental impact data** for more accurate insights.
- **Scale** the app to handle larger amounts of data.
- Develop a **mobile app** version of **Binit**.
- Introduce more **rewards** and **incentives** to encourage better waste management.
